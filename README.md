A simple data manipulation and visualization project.

I started with Netflix's new report titled What We Watched, available publically here: https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-a-netflix-engagement-report

I used Python to extrapolate two new columns of data based solely on the Titles of the shows provided. I created columns labeling Titles as TV or Movie, and as English or Foreign.
The report has consistent title nomenclature, so I was able to handle them systematically with relative accuracy.

I created some basic visualizations with Python in a notebook.

I also created a basic dashboard with slicers, cards, a stacked bar chart, and a line chart to help interpret the data.
